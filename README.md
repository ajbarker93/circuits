# circuits

A repository of printed circuit boards designed using KiCad.

LIAD: a PCB mount for ultra-violet LEDs. Intended use: illumination of a magneto-optical trap chamber to boost vapour pressure.

NI-SCSI: a digitally-isolated breakout for a National Instruments SCSI connector to generate 4x8 data lines for serial communication. Each block of 8 digital lines is combined with a regulated voltage source.

Urukul: a PCB to convert TTL digital signals into LVDS signals for compatibility with the Sinara Urukul DDS board (https://github.com/sinara-hw/Urukul/wiki).
